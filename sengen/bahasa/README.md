# Vocabulary Facts

  * kids learn 3000 new words each year
  * 300 are taught, 2700 are picked up in the street
  * Oxford English Dictionary contains 170,000 words in current use
  * average pesron uses 12,000 to 20,000
  * Shakespear used 30,000 in his works
  * For everyday conversational needs, you need about 2500 words to communicate effectively in a wide range of social and practical situations. You can make yourself understood with many fewer words than that, but you would have a hard time if you knew less than 1500 words, because communication is always two-way - you wouldn't understand what the other person was saying back to you.
  * Most native speakers use more than 3,000 words regularly, irrespective of their level of education, and they have a "passive vocabulary" of 15-20,000 words that they know but don't often use. Professional writers and translators tend to have an active vocabulary of 20,000 - 30,000 words and a passive vocabulary of 150,000+. Most people know far more words than they realise.
