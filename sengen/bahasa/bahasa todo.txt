sweep
	add a way to count the use of non-seed words in a pattern
	x in addition to count, keep timestamp, normal and reverse

~ go thru lesson plan and decide how and when to introduce sentence patterns

x which patterns to practice now?
	if the target word is a pattern
		build a sentence using all mastered words
		there is no seed word in this case

which patterns to use in review sentences?
	choose random pattern from the list of mastered patterns

make use of vocab mastery
	fix loadvocab
		get only mastered vocab
		every time a word is mastered, add it to the data.vocab

Sen Gen
	- $nun $nun requires matching
	~ $nun $nun requires first $nun be $dem phrase.

refresh lessons list, after practice complete

read next lesson ahead, after practice complete
	load into g.data.nextlesson = 
	then on "continue with next lesson"
	g.data.lesson = g.data.nextlesson
	that means making the server call with a different on= value

gradually change system strings from English to Bahasa, when in program mode, depending on lesson mastery

add patterns, during review set

x add word count to lesson record: new words, new patterns
