The root chakra is where the three main nadis separate and begin their upward movement. 
Dormant Kundalini rests here, wrapped three and a half times around the black Svayambhu linga, 
the lowest of three obstructions to her full rising (also known as knots or granthis).[38] 
It is the seat of the red bindu, the female drop (which in Tibetan vajrayana is located at the navel chakra).[clarification needed]

 It is at the ajna chakra that the two side nadis Ida and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality. 
In Tibetan Buddhism, this point is actually the end of the central channel, since the central channel rises up from the sexual organ to the crown of the head, and then curves over the head and down to the third eye. While the central channel finishes here, the two side channels continue down to the two nostrils. 


bliss = awareness of oneself as the creator
